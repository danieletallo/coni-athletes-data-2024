# coni-athletes-data-2024
 "coni-athletes-data-2024" is a web scraping project that collects information about Italian athletes who participated in the 2024 Olympics from the official CONI website. The data is organized and exported into an Excel file, making it easy to view, analyze, and share.

If you're not interested in the code, here's how to run the project and get the Excel file:
1) Navigate to the bin\Release directory.
2) Open the 'CONI_Ita.exe.config' file with Notepad and edit the 'ExcelFilePath' parameter by specifying the directory where you want the file to be saved.
3) Run the 'CONI_Ita.exe' file and wait about 10 minutes. The program will fetch the latest data from the CONI website and generate an up-to-date Excel file.

It's not optimized... but it works.
